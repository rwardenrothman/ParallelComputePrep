Takeda Parallel Compute Prep documentation
==========================================

This project serves as a learning resource for understanding and utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scientific computing. It focuses on exploring AWS Batch, AWS ParallelCluster, AWS HealthOmics, and AWS Step Functions to manage large-scale datasets, accelerate research workflows, and enable precision medicine.

Key objectives include:
- Gaining hands-on experience with AWS Batch for high-throughput and parallelized workloads.
- Learning to deploy and manage traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments with AWS ParallelCluster.
- Exploring AWS HealthOmics for multi-omics data analysis and bioinformatics workflows.
- Understanding how to orchestrate complex scientific pipelines using AWS Step Functions.
