## Highlights
- In AWS, operational excellence is defined as a commitment to build software correctly, while consistently delivering a great customer experience.
- As a pillar, it contains best practices for organizing your team, designing your workload, operating at scale, and evolving over time.
-  and practices achieved from operational excellence benefits and drives towards continuous integration and continuous delivery, or CI/CD workflows by helping developers achieve high-quality results consistently.
- This framework is aimed at professionals in technology roles, including chief technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members.
- the Well-Architected Framework enables you to consistently measure your architectures against AWS best practices and identify opportunities for enhancement.
- Stop guessing your capacity needs: If you overestimate or underestimate capacity when you deploy a workload, you might need to deal with expensive idle resources or the performance implications of limited capacity. Cloud computing can reduce these types of problems. With the cloud, you can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and you can also scale up and down automatically.
- Consider evolutionary architectures: In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, one-time events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to evolve, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the ability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. Thus, systems can evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.
- This review process is a way to include consistency in the learning of AWS best practices, measuring of architectures against those practices, identifying architecture risks, and creating an improvement plan to address them.
- The purpose of the review is to identify any critical issues that might need addressing, or areas that could be improved, with the outcome being a set of actions geared towards improving the performance of the workload.
- Well-Architected Framework Review, or WAFR. Those phases are: prepare, where the team and scope of the workload is identified; review, where the workload is reviewed and a report is created; and then improve, where you prioritize high- and medium-risk issues, and create your treatment plan.
- there is an AWS tool that assists in guiding you through the process of reviewing your workloads and applications, identifying opportunities for improvements, and tracking progress over time. This resource is called the AWS Well-Architected Tool.
- AWS has identified best practices and core strategies for architecting systems in the cloud. The result, which is the AWS Well-Architected Framework, is a way of structuring these concepts to help you better make decisions while building and working with solutions and systems on AWS.
- The structure is used to provide a way for you to effectively and consistently measure your architectures against best practices, and identify areas for improvement.
- The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on pillars, which can be seen as the primary areas of focus around which everything is organized. The pillars are Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.
- A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other components.
- Second is the term workload, which is used to identify a set of components that deliver business value, and is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about.
- And the third term I want to define is architecture, which is used to describe how components work together in a workload.
